# Discord Raid Bot

**ðŸ“œA bot to raid discord servers made for the purpose of learning.**

- My first bot made by reading the discord.py documentation

- Remember to use "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the cmd before using the code!

- You must install FFmpeg in order to use the music features of the code and add the path in environment variables https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html

- The bot will function as a music bot until a whitelisted user uses the "play" command on the server

# Commands

**/play**
> This command starts the raid

**/pitch**
> This command creates a server invite and sends it to the python terminal

**/help**
> This command does absolutely nothing
